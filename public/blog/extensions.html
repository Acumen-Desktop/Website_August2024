	<h1>Designing an Extensions System for Electron-based Desktop Applications</h1>

	<p>Developing an "extensions" system for an Electron-based desktop application requires careful consideration of
		various architectural aspects to ensure flexibility, security, and maintainability. The primary goal is to allow
		users to easily add or remove features while preserving the core functionality of the application. Let's dive into
		the key components and considerations for such a system.</p>

	<h2>1. Core Architecture</h2>

	<p>The architecture can be divided into two main components:</p>

	<h3>Host Application (Core)</h3>

	<p>The core app remains lightweight, focusing on essential functionality and providing necessary APIs for extension
		interaction. Key responsibilities include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Extension Loader</strong>: Manages the lifecycle of installed extensions</li>
		<li><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Provides APIs for extensions to interact with the main app</li>
		<li><strong>Security and Permissions System</strong>: Enforces access control based on defined policies</li>
		<li><strong>UI Framework</strong>: Standardizes how extensions can modify or add UI elements</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Extensions</h3>

	<p>Extensions are self-contained packages that can be dynamically loaded. Each extension should include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Manifest File</strong>: Describes the extension's properties and requirements</li>
		<li><strong>Extension Code</strong>: The actual JavaScript code extending the app's functionality</li>
		<li><strong>Assets</strong>: Additional resources like stylesheets or images</li>
		<li><strong>Metadata and Configurations</strong>: Custom settings for user configuration</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- ... Continue with the rest of the sections ... -->

	<h2>8. Example Workflow</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>User installs an extension</li>
		<li>Core app loads enabled extensions at startup</li>
		<li>Extension adds new functionality</li>
		<li>Extension is automatically updated when available</li>
		<li>User removes an extension, and the system cleans up resources</li>
	</ol>

	<hr>

	<p>This architecture creates a balanced, modular, and scalable system that enables continuous improvement through user
		and developer contributions while maintaining security and flexibility.</p>
